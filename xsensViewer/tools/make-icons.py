"""Regenerates the application icons from the master artwork.

Run from the repository root:  python3 tools/make-icons.py
Needs Pillow (pip install pillow). The .icns step additionally needs macOS,
and is skipped elsewhere - the committed .icns only changes when the artwork
does, so a non-mac contributor can leave it alone.

The master art is a rounded square drawn on a white page. Two obvious ways to
drop that page do not work:

  * making every white pixel transparent punches holes in the dolphin's belly,
    the net and the axis labels, which are white too;
  * flooding inwards from the border leaks along the white net lines, which run
    right up to the edge of the artwork.

So the outline is generated instead: the artwork's bounding box and corner
radius are measured, and a rounded rectangle of those dimensions becomes the
alpha channel. It is drawn supersampled for a smooth edge, and inset a few
pixels because the master is a JPEG whose edge is an anti-aliased white-to-navy
ramp - cutting exactly on the outline would leave a white fringe behind.
